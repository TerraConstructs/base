# TerraConstructs

**TerraConstructs** is a library of classes and interfaces inspired by [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk), but designed to leverage the power and flexibility of Terraform. Built using [CDKTF](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk), TerraConstructs enables developers to define cloud infrastructure using familiar object-oriented programming patterns, while taking advantage of Terraform/OpenTofu's broad provider ecosystem and efficient state management.

With TerraConstructs, you can write infrastructure as code that is intuitive, modular, and maintainable. It combines the ease of high-level constructs with the powerful capabilities of Terraform providers, offering an exceptional developer experience for defining and managing cloud resources.

### Why TerraConstructs?

- **Object-Oriented Constructs**: Simplify infrastructure definition with reusable, high-level constructs that abstract complexity.
- **Terraform Integration**: Use the extensive Terraform provider ecosystem for multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud deployments.
- **Inspired by AWS CDK**: Enjoy similar patterns and abstractions with the flexibility to go beyond AWS.
